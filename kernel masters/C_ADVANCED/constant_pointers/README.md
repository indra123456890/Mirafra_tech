1) WAP to check if an   architecture is Little Endian or Big Endian? 

2) WAP copy 0x20 data in to 0x7800 memory location? 
3) Write a macro to find size of a variable using pointers 
4) Write a macro to find size of a given data typeusing pointers 
5) "Write a program to reverse the words in a string.
eg., input : Kernel Masters is best for embedded.
output : embedded for best is Masters Kernel."
6) "Write a function that takes a main string and two sub strings (need not be same length), and replace every occurrence of first substring with the second substring in main string and return a new string as output.

eg., input : kernel  e   xxx

output: kxxxrnxxxl"

7)  "Complete the below program :
int x; int y;
int * const ptr = &x;
we cannot modify ptr to point to a different address using ptr directly. Do it indirectly."


8)  "Complete the below program :
const int x;
const int * ptr;
ptr = &x;
x value cannot be changed using x or *ptr. Do it indirectly."

9) "Complete the below program :
const int x = 10;
const int y = 10;
const int * const ptr = &x;
int **pptr = &ptr;
modify the value of x,y , and ptr (to point to y). You can only create one extra pointer variable."


10) Implement atof function ( string to float conversion)

function takes a numerical string as input and returns the equivalent float number as output.

eg., input : 3.145600

output: 3.145
